This repo contains several questions one can practice for coding interviews. The questions are mostly solved in Java, but the principles would apply to other languages for the most part.

# Prepare for Interview
Use the following resources to prepare for SWE interviews. Note that this is not an exhaustive list, and does not replace real life experience :-)
- Book - **Cracking the coding Interview** [At minimum, go over Ch. 2 (Linked List), 4 (Trees & Graphs), 6 (Math & Logic Puzzles),
    8 (Recursion & Dynamic Programming), and 9 (System Design & Scalability)].

- Book - **Elements of Programming Interviews** [At minimum, go over Ch. 16 (Recursion), 17 (Dynamic Programming),
    20 (Parallel Computing), 21 (Design Problems), 25 (Honors Class)].

- Coding Site - **Leetcode.com** [Solve all problems]

- Coding Site - **ideserve.co.in** [Solve problems from areas where you think you need more practice]

- Coding Site - **GeeksForGeeks.org** [Solve problems from areas where you think you need more practice]

- Coding Site - **CareerCup.com** [Go over recent questions from company you are interviewing with]

  + In general, if you arrive at an exponential run-time naive solution, DP could be a possible solution to reduce the complexity by trading with space

- Recursion:
  + Start with Programming Interviews Exposed book
  + Go over leetcode.com questions

- Java Concurrency Primer:

- Graphs:
  + Top Coder - https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/introduction-to-graphs-and-their-data-structures-section-1/
  + DFS Traversal - Most suited for problems where you want to visit all nodes in graph to find a solution, but not necessarily the shortest path
  
# Few Tips:
- For questions with recursive solution, practice the iterative solution too. This is a common Interview variation
- Calculate the Big-O notation for space & time complexity for all questions.
- Practice questions in IDE, whiteboard, as well as in online tools such as coderpad.
- Remember the .length() vs .size() vs .length vs .count vs .count() variations in common structures.
    + String: s.length()
    + Array: arr.length
    + HashSet: s.size()
    + HashMap: m.size()
    + List: l.size()
    + LinkedList: l.size()
- Remember Common Data Structure functions:
    + String:
      - .length() : int
      - .charAt(index) : char
      - .toCharArray() : char[]
    + HashMap:
      - .put(key, value) : void
      - .get(key) : T value
      - .containsKey(key) : boolean
      - .size() : int
    + HashSet:
      - .add(key):  void
      - .contains(key) : boolean
    + Array:
      - .length : int
    + List:
      - .size() : int
      - .add(T) : boolean
      - .remove(T) : boolean
      - .contains(T) : boolean
      - .indexOf(T) : int
      - .isEmpty() : boolean

# Final Practice Questions
- Design a Stack data structure that support O(1) operations for push, pop, peek, peekMax, and popMax
- Design a Stack data structure that support O(1) operations for push, pop, and peekMiddle, and popMiddle
- Write a program to find length of longest palindromic sub-sequence in array. Example if the array is [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 8, 1], the longest subsequence is of length 6 (1,2,3,3,2,1).
- Return all representations of a phone number in character. Example, given "12", you must return ["1a", "1b", "1c", "12"]
- Intersection and union of a sorted Linked List

# Non-Technical Questions
- Tell me about your background, experience, and what brings you here?
- Tell me why you want to leave your current company?
- Can't you find something similar at your current company in a different team?
- What other places are you interviewing at?
- Go in-depth with one of your recent projects.
- What do you like about this company?
- Tell me about your most significant accomplishment.
- Did you have to deal with conflicts where there was dis-agreement with another senior engineer? How did you deal with it?
- What do you want to do 5 years from now?
- What are you looking for in the new role? Or what would be an ideal role for you?
- Why did you switch between Developer/Test roles?
